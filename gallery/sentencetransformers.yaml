description: |
    This framework provides an easy method to compute dense vector representations for sentences, paragraphs, and images. The models are based on transformer networks like BERT / RoBERTa / XLM-RoBERTa etc. and achieve state-of-the-art performance in various tasks. Text is embedded in vector space such that similar text are closer and can efficiently be found using cosine similarity.
